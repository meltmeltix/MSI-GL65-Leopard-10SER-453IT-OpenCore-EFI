## What's working
- Bluetooth Working
- Wifi Working
- USB-A Working
- USB-C Working
- SD Card Reader Working
- Audio Working (NOTICE BELOW)
- iServices Working (NOTICE BELOW)

**AUDIO NOTICE**: This sadly doesn't seems to be fixable - if you reboot from Windows and boot to MacOS, the audio won't most likely work. To fix this, either **SHUT DOWN** from Windows and then boot to MacOS, OR **SHUT DOWN** from MacOS, wait a couple of seconds and then boot into MacOS again.

**ISERVICES NOTICE**: iServices work without any issues in MacOS. However, you MUST need to set up them manually, as per each model has different naming conventions, addresses and more. Follow [Dortania's iServices fixing guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html) for more info.
